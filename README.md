🌦️ Weather App – API Based Frontend Project

This project is a responsive, API-based Weather Application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The main goal of this project is to strengthen my frontend development skills while working with real-world APIs and dynamic data handling.

The application allows users to search for any city and instantly view real-time weather information fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates how frontend applications communicate with external APIs, handle asynchronous operations, and update the UI dynamically based on user input.

🔑 Key Features

🌍 Search weather by city name

🌡️ Displays current temperature in Celsius

🌤️ Shows weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rain, etc.)

💧 Displays humidity percentage

🌬️ Shows wind speed

⚠️ Error handling for invalid or empty city input

📱 Fully responsive UI using Bootstrap

🎨 Clean and user-friendly design

🧠 Concepts & Skills Covered

This project covers several important frontend and JavaScript concepts, including:

DOM manipulation using JavaScript

Asynchronous programming with async/await

Fetching data from a REST API using fetch()

Error handling with try/catch

Dynamic HTML rendering using template literals

Bootstrap grid system and utility classes

Responsive web design principles

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

HTML5 – Structure of the application

CSS3 – Custom styling

Bootstrap 5 – Layout, responsiveness, and UI components

JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic, API handling, and interactivity

OpenWeatherMap API – Real-time weather data

🚀 Purpose of This Project

The purpose of building this Weather App is to:

Practice frontend development using real APIs

Improve JavaScript logic and asynchronous handling

Learn how to design responsive applications with Bootstrap

Create a strong portfolio project suitable for interviews

This project represents a practical implementation of frontend concepts and is a step toward building more advanced applications.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add dark mode

Show weather based on current location

Add loading animation

Support temperature unit conversion (°C / °F)

Save recent searches using localStorage
